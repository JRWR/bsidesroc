## Insecure Design Patterns in IoT {#Insecure-Design-Patterns-in-IoT}[M. Carlton](/schedule/speakers#M.-Carlton)

This talk will explore vulnerabilities resulting from insecure design patterns in internet-connected embedded devices using real-world examples. In the course of our research, we have observed a pattern of manufacturers incorporating design choices that make an attacker’s job easier. We will explore in technical detail how these design flaws resulted in vulnerabilities in three popular devices.


## Attacking Modern SaaS Companies {#Attacking-Modern-SaaS-Companies}[Sean Cassidy](/schedule/speakers#Sean-Cassidy)

Modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have a large footprint and a lot of automation which enables them to build their service quickly. However, because many devops and cloud tools and processes are new, many companies don't understand the risks and don't plan with security in mind. Even some practiced network pentesters don't always know the best way to find vulnerabilities in these complex cloud-based systems.  This talk is an introduction to pentesting these companies and is focused on giving attendees a breadth of knowledge on the new tech – like microservices, serverless computing, configuration management, and containers – that modern SaaS companies are using. You'll learn how to attack them and pivot towards high value targets or how to defend yourself against these attacks and how to monitor for breaches. A new remote access tool for AWS will be released to control AWS accounts with a minimum chance of observation.


## Reverse Engineering Techniques for Game Hacking {#Reverse-Engineering-Techniques-for-Game-Hacking}[Nick Collisson](/schedule/speakers#Nick-Collisson)

Reverse engineering is an integral part of PC game cheat development. Since game hacks frequently rely on the ability to read from and write to specific data structures within a game's memory, a game hack developer must understand how these structures can be accessed. In object-oriented applications, such as those written in C++, the relevant data structures are often dynamically-allocated objects located on the heap. In these cases it is necessary to determine sequences of pointers and offsets that traverse the binary's data structures that reliably lead from predictable memory locations to the data structures of interest. This talk discusses a general approach for finding these kinds of pointer sequences and introduces a new tool which implements this approach.


## Real Security Incidents, Unusual Situations {#Real-Security-Incidents-Unusual-Situations}[Adam Dean](/schedule/speakers#Adam-Dean)

The pace of databreaches has reached epic proportions. Organizations large and small, in every industry are falling victim to hackers, hacktivists and nation states. Incident Response is a dynamic process where the unsuspected often becomes the root cause. From insider threats to unauthorized access with a bit of extortion, it isn’t always what it seems. Take a walk with us down some seemingly normal paths that lead to the unexpected. Real security incidents, unusual situations.


## The Hardest CTF I've Ever Done: My Experiences Reverse Engineering an MMORPG {#The-Hardest-CTF-I've-Ever-Done:-My-Experiences-Reverse-Engineering-an-MMORPG}[Dave Kukfa](/schedule/speakers#Dave-Kukfa)

MMORPGs provide countless hours of entertainment by allowing gamers to escape into exciting virtual worlds and form communities through their online interactions. However, these games are almost entirely at the mercy of their publishers: if the game is decommissioned and the server is shut down, these virtual worlds cease to exist, game communities are broken up, and the game is left virtually unplayable. At this point, many turn to reverse engineering the game to restore gameplay -- a long, arduous technical challenge that is riddled with pitfalls and gotchas. This talk covers the journey I’ve gone through while reverse engineering a decommissioned MMORPG over the past 2 years. Technical aspects will be discussed, as well as legal implications and a project demo.

## Insecure Obsolete and Trivial: The Real IOT {#Insecure-Obsolete-and-Trivial-The-Real-IOT}[Price McDonald and Justin Berry](/schedule/speakers#Price-McDonald-and-Justin-Berry)

Over the last few years Hardware Hacking has become a much more prevalent testing and attack avenue.  This talk is meant to give a basic understanding of Hardware Hacking techniques, tips and tricks.  In addition to real world examples and demos.


## Defeating Application Defenses Through XSS {#Defeating-application-defenses-through-XSS}[Matt Metzger](/schedule/speakers#Matt-Metzger)

## Decoder Improved: An Improved Burp Suite Decoder {#Decoder-Improved:-An-Improved-Burp-Suite-Decoder}[Justin Moore](/schedule/speakers#Justin-Moore)

Burp Suite is great. Burp Suite's decoder is not so great. I've written a Burp Suite extension to replace Burp Suite's decoder that is great. 


## The Guild: The Rise and <s>Fall</s> Future of Syracuse's Hackerspace {#The-Guild:-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Syracuse's-Hackerspace}[Mo Morsi & Mark Scrano](/schedule/speakers#Mo-Morsi)

This talk will give a complete history of the Syracuse Innovators Guild, Syracuse's first hacker space which opened in 2010 and shutdown in 2016. We will cover the struggles and difficulties of running a community space. 


## Robust Defense For The Rest of Us {#Robust-Defense-for-the-rest-of-us}[Russell Mosley & Ryan St. Germain](/schedule/speakers#Russell-Mosley-&-Ryan-St.-Germain)

While browsing CFP's for conferences this summer, one speaking track named "The Art of Defense" had a statement that “only the largest enterprises can afford a robust defense”.  We disagree, and argue that in many ways small-to-medium-size businesses can be more secure than large enterprises.  We will provide an overview of the security program we built that achieves enterprise-level protection AND regulatory compliance WITHOUT a massive budget or huge silo'd teams.  Consider it a case study or howto for building an effective security program at a small business. 


## Whose Idea Was That? Comparing Security Curriculums and Accreditations To Industry Needs {#Whose-idea-was-that-Comparing-Security-curriculums-and-accreditations-to-industry-needs}[Rob Olson and Chaim Sanders](/schedule/speakers#Rob-Olson-and-Chaim-Sanders)

Security is hard but security education may be harder. Few academic institutions have the skills or resources to dedicate solely to security education. Rather, most security programs in higher education have grown out of or have been welded on to other technology programs. The resulting fractured educational ecosystem has created a disparity in the skill sets of graduating students and has it challenging to develop standards to ensure consistency across educational programs. This talk will take a look at how security curricula have traditionally been developed and continued to be shaped by a variety of forces. We will examine some of the proposed solutions for accrediting programs and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently we will try to determine which type of student each model designed to produce and provide our own recommendations about how to standardize security education.


## Responding to Cyber Attack at Machine Speed {#Responding-to-Cyber-Attack-at-Machine-Speed}[Duncan Sparrell](/schedule/speakers#Duncan-Sparrell)

Cyber-attacks are increasing in terms of sophistication, speed and dynamics. Advanced cyber actors (and even script kiddies) are utilizing automation with adaptive tradecraft and these trends are likely to continue. To combat this we need to facilitate interoperability and integration by standardizing interfaces & protocols allowing more flexible and interoperable cyber defense components.  OpenC2 is being created to standardize machine-to-machine command & control (C2) to enable cyber defense system interoperability at machine speeds. The author believes that there is an economic driver for adoption even prior to automated defense, ie that having a standard interface to perform security command & control avoids the vendor lock-in that results from today’s proprietary interfaces.  The talk will begin with the problem openC2 is trying to solve, provide a review of openC2 and its use cases, and give the current status on standardization.  


## Get Low (To all STC STC STC STC) {#Get-Low-(To-all-STC-STC-STC-STC)}[Jon Szymaniak](/schedule/speakers#Jon-Szymaniak)

Tired of the pedestrian convenience offered by high level languages? Want to role your own handcrafted, artisnal, and GMO-free shellcode? Looking to grok disassembler output during late nights of reversing?  Whatever the reason, come to this talk for a quick intro to ARM assembly languages. We'll focus on learning assembly by writing and debugging it via the Unicorn CPU emulator framework. All the while, we'll keep an eye towards applying our newfound skills in exploitation and reverse engineering.


## Problems With Elliptic Curves In TLS and SSH {#Problems-With-Elliptic-Curves-In-TLS-and-SSH}[Joe Testa](/schedule/speakers#Joe-Testa)

This presentation examines the elliptic curve parameters standardized by NIST in FIPS 186-2, which are suspected by some as being back-doored by the NSA.  Despite being first introduced over 17 years ago, these curve parameters remain highly prevalent, as they are central to both the TLS and SSH protocols.  An overview of the history and process of their standardization will be covered, along with a discussion of the NSA's other successful back doors in NIST's standards (as revealed by Edward Snowden).  Recent developments in new curve parameters will be shown, as will a practical guide aimed at systems administrators for disabling the suspicious curve parameters in TLS and SSH.


## How I Broke Into Your Datacenter {#How-I-Broke-Into-Your-Datacenter}[Valerie Thomas](/schedule/speakers#Valerie-Thomas)

Each year companies spend thousands of dollars on sophisticated security systems to ensure their secrets stay safe.  Physical security flaws can be found everywhere from razor wire fences to RFID cards if you know where to look.  Valerie has performed physical security assessments across the country from Federal buildings to ICS/SCADA locations and beyond. Join her for an hour of war stories, dos and don’ts of physical penetration security, vulnerability trends and some prevention basics.


## Data Breach Response: Why Communication Fails {#Data-Breach-Response:-Why-Communication-Fails}[Claire Tills](/schedule/speakers#Claire-Tills)

Organizations don't seem to be improving their data breach response despite how many failures we have seen. Using theories from crisis communication, this talk will explore how organizations are communicating about breaches and delve into some potential reasons why  those responses can fail so hard


## Common Developer Crypto Mistakes (with illustrations in Java) {#Common-Developer-Crypto-Mistakes-(with-illustrations-in-Java)}[Kevin W. Wall](/schedule/speakers#Kevin-W.-Wall)

During the past 7 years, Kevin has examined how cryptography has been used in close to 200+ different projects from a security risk perspective. This includes 85+ design reviews and a 100+ secure code reviews (mostly Java with some C/C++ and C# thrown in for good measure) performed for two different companies. That includes both proprietary code of these 2 companies, proprietary vendor code reviewed under NDAs, as well as some FOSS code. This talk explores the most commonly observed applied cryptography mistakes made by developers during that 7 year window and briefly describes how to correct them.


## Systematic Network Security Troubleshooting (pcaps or get out) {#Systematic-Network-Security-Troubleshooting-(pcaps-or-gtfo)}[Jason Woodson](/schedule/speakers#Jason-Woodson)

Network security can involve a variety of complex technologies and disciplines, often managed by separate teams and third parties. Client-server traffic can be impacted at many points along the path, and it's not always obvious where to troubleshoot when there are problems. Taking shots in the dark or jumping to conclusions wastes time and resources. This talk presents a systematic approach to network security troubleshooting, working through the stack in a deliberate fashion, to narrow down root causes quickly and accurately. 


## Here We Go Again - A PenTester's Year in Review {#Here-We-Go-Again---A-PenTester's-Year-in-Review}[Tyler Wrightson](/schedule/speakers#Tyler-Wrightson)

In this talk Tyler reviews the interesting, hilarious, unique, awesome and familiar things that happened in the past year during penetration tests. All of the information is from first hand experience and will give attendees insight into how organizations are actually broken into. The attack vectors include intrusions via external, internal, social engineering, physical, and more.


## It’s Time to Innovate for Cyber Defense (How to Out-Hack the Cyber Cracker) {#It’s-Time-to-Innovate-for-Cyber-Defense-(How-to-Out-Hack-the-Cyber-Cracker)}[Ernest Y. Wong](/schedule/speakers#Ernest-Y.-Wong)

Innovation is critical to improvements within our society and is a key component in the cyber domain. The exponential growth of the internet means that the tools for operating in cyberspace are constantly evolving. It has often been said, however, that the only innovation taking place in cyber warfare is in offensive cyber operations. So where is the innovation in defensive cyber operations? In order to defend the core of cyberspace against malicious actors, is there sufficient defensive innovation taking place? And if such innovation is indeed happening, why does it seem as though the attacker always seems to be at least one step ahead of the defender? To address these complex concerns, this presentation starts with an examination of four distinct types of innovation—breakthrough, disruptive, incremental, and sustaining. Sustaining and incremental innovations tend to generate improvements within existing systems, but they usually originate as a reactive response to market needs and produce improvements based upon easily recognizable needs. Breakthrough and disruptive innovations, on the other hand, target new and underserved markets in their design and tend to be more proactive in shaping their environment in oftentimes unforeseen and drastic ways. Through the understanding that clear distinctions exist within what we term “innovation,” we are then able to comprehend that gaining an upper hand against cyberattacks requires that we determine the type of innovation our adversaries are developing and employing. Only then will we be able to grasp why our current system for cyber defense may be failing and, more importantly, advance the right defensive innovations that will prevail in this rapidly changing domain.

## Breaking is Bad: Why Everyone at This Conference Will be Unemployed {#Breaking-is-Bad}[Reg Harnish](/schedule/speakers#Reg-Harnish)

G IS DEAD. Yes, you heard it right. Dead. Finito. Mortis. And if your 
career is attached to pentesting, it may be picking out its own headstone: 
"Here Rests Carl's Career, Confined to PenTesting, Now Instead of Buying 
Islands It's Laying Here Resting."

The data is concrete, the statistics are irrefutable. The opportunity in 
cybersecurity has transitioned from breaking things to building things. CEOs 
and executives throughout North America are becoming less interested in 
proving negatives, and more interested in proving competitive advantage. 
Cybersecurity has become synonymous with business and the decision is yours
- be part of the problem, or be part of the solution.

Join me as we explore the dynamically changing cybersecurity 
industry and how you can profit or plummet."
