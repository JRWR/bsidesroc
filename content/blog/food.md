Here is an update on plans for Breakfast and Lunch:

**Breakfast**: We will have coffee and water available for all attendees to start their morning.
But no actual food will be served. RIT has restaurants that will be open if you get hungry in the
morning. 

**Lunch**: For lunch, we've contacted Whole-E Roasters and The Meatball Co. food trucks wich will pull up to the north entrance of the GCCIS building where BSIdesROC will be. Prices range from $5 and up for some good grub. 

The conference will conclude by dinner time so no dinner will be served. See you this saturday!
