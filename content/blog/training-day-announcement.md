Come one come all to the BSidesROC Training Day. We're finally announcing the classes that we'll have available the day before the BSidesROC conference. Today, attendees can sign up for classes related to network penetration testing, malware analysis, WiFi hacking, and social engineering. We've worked with our trainers to keep the classes at a reasonably low price. 

Visit our [Training Day](/events/training-day) page for details and directions for buying a ticket.
